User Story 6: 

As a user, I want to be able to organize files in a directory by moving them to subdirectories based on their extensions so that I can easily locate and access my files. The function should display a progress bar and allow me to cancel the process if necessary. The function should only move files with extensions .txt, .csv, .xlsx, .doc, and .pdf to their respective subdirectories.

Navigating and Overcoming Technical Challenges:

Understanding regular expressions: 

The search function of the project uses regular expressions to find files that contain a specific text pattern. Regular expressions can be challenging to understand and require some practice to use effectively.

Practice using regular expressions and utilize online resources such as regex101.com to test expressions.

Custom exception handling: 

Creating a custom exception class and handling it correctly is challenging, especially for new developers. 

Coordinated with seniors and mentors to get their advice and by self study and information from internet created custom exception.

Working with different file formats: 

different file formats has its own syntax and conventions, and the developer needs to be familiar with them.

Hands-on practice - Gained hands-on experience by working on small exercises that involve different file formats. 
Discussed challenges, shared knowledge, and learned from each other's experiences to broaden our understanding of file format handling.

File searching: 

The search_files function needs to search for files in a directory and its subdirectories that match a specific text pattern. This can be challenging, especially if the directory contains a large number of files. 

Begin by researching different techniques for efficient file searching. 
Utilize online resources such as tutorials, articles, and documentation related to file searching.
